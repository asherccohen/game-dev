Usage Example
The machine integrates with your existing ECS system and provides a robust foundation for your text-tactical wargame's progression system!

missionTimeLimit

```bash
import { createActor } from 'xstate';
import { gameLoopMachine } from './machine-two';

// Create the machine with initial context
const gameActor = createActor(gameLoopMachine, {
  input: {
    tickDuration: 3000, // 3-second ticks
    victoryCondition: 'elimination',
    isRealTime: false, // Start turn-based
  }
});

// Start the game
gameActor.start();
gameActor.send({ type: 'START_GAME' });

// Submit orders
gameActor.send({
  type: 'SUBMIT_ORDER',
  order: {
    unit: 'Alpha Squad',
    action: 'move',
    destination: 'Ridge Point'
  }
});

// Advance manually (turn-based)
gameActor.send({ type: 'ADVANCE_TICK' });

// Switch to real-time
gameActor.send({ type: 'SET_REAL_TIME', enabled: true });
```
