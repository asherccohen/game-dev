# WAR TACTICS

## üéØ Ideation: A New Genre

Let‚Äôs imagine a new genre: **Text‚ÄëTactical Wargame (TTW)**.

### Core Pillars

- **Minimal or ASCII‚Äëlevel UI**
  No sprites or maps. Everything is text or simple symbols. E.g. ASCII grid, or turn‚Äëbased command interface.

- **Tactical Simulation Engine**
  Focus strictly on operations: unit command, logistics, terrain effects abstracted. No base building, just squad or small unit migrations and engagements.

- **Asynchronous Multiplayer & PBEM Hybrid**
  Players issue orders by text or API (web or CLI), then simulation runs and returns results later. Keeps pace manageable.

- **Resource‚Äëlight & cross‚Äëplatform**
  Light frontend (web, terminal, mobile via chatbots). Backend could run in Remix‚ÄëRun or Fastify + Postgres.

### Structure & Modes

- **Scenario Library**
  Pre‚Äëbuilt historical or fictional battles you can replay in text form‚Äîe.g. defensive mountain pass, river crossing, urban raid.

- **Squad/Sector Command**
  Command a handful of units; use commands like `move sectorA sectorB`, `fire artillery zone‚Äë1`, `scan`, `ambush zone‚Äë3`.

- **Fog of War & Intel**
  Reports are oblique (‚Äúscouts report enemy presence east sector‚Äù) unless you invest in recon or UAV.

- **Turn Tick Mechanic**
  You get limited action points per tick (daily or hourly). Encourages planning, not grinding.

- **Community & Competition**
  Alliances, clans, territory zones. Turn-based but can support real-time duels.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Feature Breakdown

### 1. **Interface / UI**

- ASCII grid (e.g. 10√ó10 sectors).
- Units represented by symbols (e.g. `I` infantry, `T` tank).
- Text logs describe outcomes: ‚ÄúYour platoon engaged enemy at sector C3‚Äîtwo casualties, enemy withdrew to C4.‚Äù

### 2. **Engine Mechanics**

- Units: infantry, armor, recon, artillery, UAV drones.
- Terrain modifiers: forest, hill, marsh.
- Fog/Intel: partial Fog of War with recon investment.
- Sim rules: deterministic or low RNG, with battle resolution based on strength, terrain, flanking.

### 3. **Command Flow**

- **Action Phase**: you issue orders up to your available points per unit/squad.
- **Resolution Phase**: simulation runs after deadline or both players submit.
- **Report Phase**: you get a plaintext log + updated map snapshot.

### 4. **Progression & Meta**

- Persistent account or campaign progress.
- Unit experience, veteran squads (morale, effectiveness).
- Tech tree unlocks: drones, comm upgrades, electronic warfare.

### 5. **Modes**

- Skirmish (2‚Äë4 players).
- PvE: campaigns vs AI, chain of linked missions.
- Grand campaign: persistent world, territories to conquer.

## üß† Genre Refinement

### Naming & Positioning

- Call it **TTW (Text‚ÄëTactical Wargame)** or **T‚ÄëTAC War**.
- ‚ÄúA tactical wargame delivered through text, built for deep strategy, accessible anywhere.‚Äù

### Differentiators from existing games

| Deployment  | Browser only                   | Also terminal or Discord/Telegram bots UI                     |

- Almost **no visual representation**
- No ASCII grids, maps, or tiles
- Pure **textual or symbolic output**
- Fully focused on **strategy, tactics, and decision-making**

---

## üß† Game Core: Tactical Command by Language

### Game Concept

You‚Äôre a **field commander**, **task force leader**, or **special operations director**. You give high-level orders via a command interface (text or predefined structured commands). The system interprets those and simulates outcomes. You get briefings, reports, and intel, all in written or symbolic form.

Imagine:

```bash
> Deploy recon drone to sector Echo
> Ambush convoy along Route 4
> Coordinate artillery strike at gridpoint Lima-2
> Initiate fallback from urban AO by 0400Z
```

The game plays out like a mix of:

- **Military D\&D**: you issue narrative-level commands
- **PBEM Wargaming**: orders submitted, simulation runs
- **Intel/Command Sim**: you only see the battlefield through reports, dispatches, and decoded messages

---

## üì¶ Structure: Modular Layers of Complexity

### 1. **World State**

No visible map. World state is described through:

- Named **zones** or **regions** ("Sector Echo", "Bridgepoint", "Ridge 7")
- Temporal anchors ("before 0500Z", "at nightfall")
- Status descriptions ("contested", "reinforced", "no contact")

Example:

```bash
[0415Z] SIGINT: Enemy unit movement detected near Forest Line, estimated platoon strength.
[0430Z] SQUAD CHARLIE: In contact, minor resistance at Crossroads.
```

### 2. **Unit Abstraction**

You never micromanage. Units are:

- Referenced by call signs (`Alpha`, `Foxtrot-2`, `Delta Mobile`)
- Have traits: strength, morale, equipment, mission status
- Have autonomous logic: they can abort, adapt, withdraw

You issue commands like:

```bash
> Task Unit Echo with flanking maneuver via east ridge
```

And get results like:

```bash
[ETA+10] UNIT ECHO: Encountered minefield. Progress halted. Requesting engineers or reroute.
```

### 3. **Command Layer**

Instead of UI inputs, you operate in **natural language** or structured command lines:

Examples:

- `move Alpha to Ridge-3 before dawn, under radio silence`
- `establish overwatch on enemy supply route`
- `coordinate with Lima for timed breach at 0600Z`

These get parsed into:

- **Intent** (movement, action, coordination)
- **Time** (when it happens)
- **Priority/Constraints** (stealth, speed, comms)

### 4. **Simulation Engine**

Each tick (turn):

- Orders resolve based on current state, weather, logistics, terrain, morale, enemy activity
- Outcomes generate **Intel Reports**, **Action Logs**, **Casualty Reports**, **Requests**

No visible feedback‚Äîonly text results. Example:

```bash
--- SITREP 0530Z ---
UNIT BRAVO encountered entrenched enemy force at CHOKEPOINT 4.
Engaged under heavy fire. Requested CAS. ETA 12 mins.
Alpha proceeding through fallback route Delta.
```

---

## üéØ Gameplay Loop

1. **Briefing Phase**: You receive mission context, assets, threats.
2. **Command Phase**: You issue orders via structured or natural input.
3. **Resolution Phase**: Sim runs, logs outcomes, units adapt/react.
4. **Intel Phase**: You receive textual reports and make new plans.

Each round gives:

- Fog of war (some info is inaccurate)
- Situational surprises (ambush, weather, unit panic)
- Logistics/supply strain (limited radio, ammo, fuel)

---

## üìò Example Turn

### Player Turn

```bash
> Dispatch UAV to scan urban zone
> Send Alpha and Charlie to encircle enemy at Substation
> Detonate bridge if contact confirmed
```

### System Response

```bash
[0515Z] UAV scan initiated. Enemy light armor confirmed in north corridor.
[0520Z] ALPHA: Flanking via west alley. No resistance so far.
[0525Z] CHARLIE: Contact. Small arms fire. Holding at corner building.
[0527Z] Engineering charge placed. Standing by for trigger.
```

## üîÅ Genre Definition: ‚ÄúDirective-Driven Tactical Sim‚Äù

**New Genre Traits:**

| Element     | Description                                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Input       | Natural or structured command interface                |
| Output      | Textual intel, logs, and field reports                 |
| Visuals     | None or symbolic only                                  |
| Focus       | Decision-making, timing, interpretation, improvisation |
| Players     | Solo or asynchronous multiplayer                       |
| Uncertainty | Fog of war, timing variance, limited comms             |
| Strategy    | High-level ops: maneuver, deception, supply lines      |

---

## üí° Inspirations (Abstracted)

- **Invisible Inc (but without visuals)**: tension through hidden info, timers
- **Dwarf Fortress (Adventure Mode)**: simulation over presentation
- **Military AI Wargames**: red team/blue team intel cycles
- **Command: Modern Ops**: real-world logic but purely text-delivered

---

## üéØ Goal

Define a simulation engine that takes high-level **orders**, interprets them into **actions**, and resolves them into **outcomes**, all with uncertainty, constraints, and emergent behavior‚Äîpurely through **textual feedback**.

---

## üß© Simulation Engine Design

We'll break this into components:

### 1. **Order Parsing ‚Üí Intent Tree**

Each player-issued command becomes a structured **intent**:

```bash
"Move Alpha to Ridge-3 before dawn under radio silence"
‚Üí {
  unit: 'Alpha',
  action: 'move',
  target: 'Ridge-3',
  time_constraint: 'before 0600Z',
  modifiers: ['stealth'],
}
```

This gets normalized into a **directive**, which the engine processes. Complex orders are split into sub-steps (move, observe, hold).

---

### 2. **State Snapshot**

Each tick (say, 5 min or 1 hour) the simulation:

- Reads current world state:
  - unit positions, morale, health, supply, objectives
  - weather, time, known/unknown enemy intel
  - terrain type, line of sight

- Compares it to all **pending orders**
- Evaluates **context-aware feasibility**

---

### 3. **Resolver Passes**

Order resolution happens in **passes** per tick:

| Pass                 | Description                                               |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Preparation       | Units begin actions: move, set up, scout, request support |
| 2. Contact Check     | Any overlapping zones trigger engagements                 |
| 3. Combat            | Firefights, ambushes, artillery, suppression              |
| 4. Logistics         | Fuel, ammo, comms degradation, supplies en route          |
| 5. Morale            | Panic, retreat, loss of cohesion, AI aborts order         |
| 6. Report Generation | Dispatch logs are created for the player                  |

---

### 4. **Combat / Encounter Model**

Not dice-roll heavy. Resolve based on:

- **Force balance** (weapons, squad strength)
- **Initiative** (stealth, recon advantage)
- **Positioning** (cover, flanking)
- **Morale** (exhaustion, cohesion)
- **Intel** (fog of war, wrong target)

üìÑ Sample combat outcome:

```bash
[0630Z] FOXTROT ambushed convoy on Route-9.
Destroyed 2 vehicles before enemy reacted.
Retreated under mortar fire. One casualty. Ammo depleted.
```

---

### 5. **Emergent Behavior**

Units are semi-autonomous:

- Abort actions if outmatched or isolated
- Re-route around known threats
- Request backup or refuse orders (low morale)
- Execute fallback protocols if cut off

That means your command doesn't always play out 1:1.

Example:

```bash
> Assault power station with Bravo and Delta

‚Üí Bravo encountered heavy fire and stalled.
‚Üí Delta redirected to flank on its own initiative.
‚Üí Bravo now requesting smoke cover to extract.
```

---

### 6. **Fog of War / Misinformation**

Critical to realism. Every report has a **confidence level**:

- ‚ÄúUnconfirmed enemy contact east sector‚Äù
- ‚ÄúVisual on enemy armor ‚Äì likely T-72, range 800m‚Äù
- ‚ÄúIntermittent radio traffic suggests movement near ridge‚Äù

This gives a **narrative deduction loop**. You infer patterns over time.

---

### 7. **Tick Cycle (Turn Resolution)**

1. Receive new reports
2. Issue next set of orders
3. Engine simulates N minutes/hours forward
4. Generate SITREP/logs
5. Repeat

Example:

```bash
--- TICK 0700Z ---
CHARLIE: No contact. Holding perimeter.
FOXTROT: Mines cleared. Moving north.
UAV: Thermal contacts detected, 2 targets, 1 km west of your position.
HQ: Supplies delayed due to weather.
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Optional Mechanics to Layer Later

- **Signal Jamming / Electronic Warfare**
  Messages delayed, misrouted, blocked.

- **Psychological Warfare / Rumors**
  False reports affecting enemy morale or yours.

- **Command Pressure / Limited Orders**
  Can only issue X commands per turn based on bandwidth, staff, or HQ pressure.

- **Agent-based Commanders**
  Sub-commanders with personality traits‚Äîaggressive, cautious, disloyal, etc.

---

### COMMAND EXAMPLE

Move Commands

```bash
move Alpha Squad to Ridge Point
move Bravo Squad to Valley Beta before 1200Z
move Charlie Squad to Forest Edge under radio silence
move Delta Squad to High Ground before 1500Z under smoke cover and radio silence
```

Attack Commands

```bash
attack Enemy Squad with Alpha Squad
attack Hostile Unit with Bravo Squad using suppressing fire
attack Enemy Position with Charlie Squad using flanking maneuver and artillery support
```

Defend Commands

```bash
defend Ridge Point with Alpha Squad
defend Valley Beta with Bravo Squad
defend Forest Edge with Charlie Squad
```

Retreat Commands

```bash
retreat Alpha Squad
retreat Bravo Squad to Ridge Point
retreat Charlie Squad to Valley Beta when under heavy fire
retreat Delta Squad when morale low
```

## üë£ Next Steps

Want to go deeper into:

- Command grammar?
- How simulation resolves orders?
- Narrative style for intel logs?
- A sample mission pack?
- Example of a full tick execution?
- Order grammar and how players write directives?
- Narrative design of reports/intel/logs?
- Want to sketch some commands or design data model next? Happy to break it down in TypeScript.

## üõ†Ô∏è Roadmap Summary

1. Prototype engine: CLI or terminal-first version. Represent sector grid and units.
2. Rule spec: define command grammar, unit data, terrain rules.
3. Build turn execution: command parser ‚Üí simulation ‚Üí log output.
4. Minimal web UI: grid + command input + log.
5. Add multiplayer ticks and persistence.
6. Add meta features: progression, recon, tech unlocks.
7. Add community/clan features and PvP leaderboard.

## ‚úÖ Summary

Yes, minimal‚Äëgraphic or pure‚Äëtext military tactics games exist in niche browser/PBEM space, but nothing with squad‚Äëlevel tactical depth delivered via ASCII text with modern multiplayer and data‚Äëintensive design. By grounding it in a text‚Äëonly interface and focusing on asynchronous tactical simulation, you carve a new genre: **Text‚ÄëTactical Wargame**.

The simulation engine:

- Interprets intent, not raw instructions
- Runs in discrete time steps (ticks)
- Resolves actions through layered passes (movement, contact, combat, morale, logistics)
- Outputs situational text logs based on uncertain, partial information
- Encourages deductive reasoning, improvisation, and layered strategic planning

üéÆ Core Components

Game Engine (ECS)

Located in core/ecs.ts
Uses Miniplex for Entity Component System
Manages units, terrain, and game state
Handles game logic like movement and combat

Command System
Located in core/parser.ts
Parses text commands like "Move Alpha to Ridge"
Converts human text into game actions

State Management
Located in core/machine.ts
Uses XState for game state management
Handles turns, combat resolution, and game flow

UI Layer
Located in Terminal.tsx
React-based terminal interface
Shows game output and accepts commands
Styled with Tailwind CSS

üìù Data Structure

Units
Have properties like position, morale, supplies
Can be friendly or hostile
Stored in the ECS world

Terrain
Represents locations like "Ridge Alpha"
Has connections to other terrain
Affects combat and movement

Game State
Tracks current situation
Manages fog of war
Handles turn progression

üîÑ Basic Flow

- Player types command in Terminal
- Parser converts text to game action
- State machine processes the action
- ECS updates game world
- Results display in Terminal

All systems properly use the delta time parameter to scale their effects based on elapsed time. This means:

Movement system checks for valid moves (already time-independent)

Combat system:
Morale damage is now per-second (e.g., 10 damage/sec instead of just 10)
Ammunition consumption is time-based (1 unit/sec)

Morale system:
Combat stress is 5 morale loss per second
Idle recovery is 2 morale gain per second

This makes the simulation more realistic and independent of the tick rate.

Error Handling

New error state with retry/reset options
Error logging and recovery
Victory/Defeat Conditions

Three victory conditions: elimination, occupation, survival
Automatic checks after each turn
Final states with appropriate messages
Save/Load System

Save game action with timestamp
Load game capability
Persistance of game state
Turn Management

Turn counter
Turn-based events and logging
Time-based game progression
Enhanced Logging

More detailed system feedback
Error tracking
Game state transitions
The machine now handles:

Game initialization and error recovery
Command processing and execution
Continuous game simulation with the tick system
Victory and defeat conditions
Save/load functionality
Turn management
Comprehensive error handling

Think of it like a text-based chess game, where instead of moving pieces on a board, you're commanding units through text, and the game calculates and describes what happens.

### Test Categories

We'll organize our tests into these categories:

State Machine Tests

State transitions
Command processing
Victory/defeat conditions
Command Parser Tests

Order validation
Command syntax parsing
Error handling
Game World Tests

Unit movement
Combat resolution
Terrain effects
System Tests

Movement system
Combat system
Morale system

### üìå Existing Examples

- **Ultimate Warfare** ‚Äì a browser‚Äëbased, fully text strategy war game open‚Äësourced on GitHub. It once had thousands of players; features include turn ticking, resource queues, battle simulation, research, world generation. Designed in PHP originally and ported later ([Reddit][1]).

- **Ambroid**, **Promisance**, **Earth‚Äë2025** ‚Äì browser text‚Äëbased war/conquest games with strategy, economy, online players, minimal UI ([Reddit][2]).

- **Naked War** ‚Äì turn‚Äëbased strategy, play‚Äëby‚Äëemail, commanding squads via text only (no realtime graphics) ([Wikipedia][3]).

- **Xconq** ‚Äì early X‚Äëwindows or curses client, multiplayer empire building, text/hex‚Äëbased UI, open source system from the 1980s ([Wikipedia][4]).

- **Door Kickers‚ÄØ2: Task Force North** ‚Äì minimal graphics but tactical real‚Äëtime raids; top‚Äëdown, small view, few effects. Still graphical though ([scenescoop.com][5]).

So your idea occupies territory that exists in niche browser war games, PBEM (play‚Äëby‚Äëemail) strategy, and minimalist indie tactics titles‚Äîbut there's room to define something new, especially focusing on ultra-light UI and deep tactical-military mechanics.

---

### Marketing

Hey! Quick question‚Äîwould you be into a tactical war game where you issue military-style commands using just text (like chat or CLI)?
No maps or visuals, just pure strategy, unit control, and battle reports.
Think: ‚Äú> Move Alpha to Ridge-3 before dawn under radio silence‚Äù ‚Ä¶ then the engine simulates what happens.

It‚Äôs async, works on web or mobile, and all the gameplay is through SITREPs and command logs. Basically a war sim for nerds who like tactics and decision-making over graphics.

Curious if that sounds fun to you?
