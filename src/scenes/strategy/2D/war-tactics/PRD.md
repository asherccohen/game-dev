# WAR TACTICS ‚Äì Product Requirements Document

## üìò Overview

**WAR TACTICS** is a new genre of military strategy game: a **Text‚ÄëTactical Wargame (TTW)**. It removes all graphical or map-based gameplay in favor of **language-driven tactical command**. Players issue structured or natural-language orders, receive simulated battle results, and adapt to fog-of-war, morale shifts, and logistical pressure‚Äîall through textual interaction.

---

## üéØ Core Goals

* Design a **tactical simulation game** playable without maps or visuals
* Focus on **squad-level command**, intel interpretation, and decision-making
* Build around **asynchronous play**, **text interfaces**, and **emergent outcomes**
* Launch cross-platform, with CLI, web, mobile, or even chatbot UIs

## üì¶ Feature Modules

### 1. Tactical Command Interface

Players write directives such as:

```bash
> Move Alpha to Ridge-3 before dawn under radio silence
> Establish overwatch on convoy route
> Delay retreat until Bravo confirms extraction
```

These are parsed into:

```ts
{
  unit: "Alpha",
  action: "move",
  destination: "Ridge-3",
  time_constraint: "before 0600Z",
  modifiers: ["stealth"]
}
```

### 2. Simulation Engine

Each tick simulates:

1. **Preparation** ‚Äì Movement, recon, setup
2. **Contact** ‚Äì Engagement triggers
3. **Combat** ‚Äì Battle mechanics
4. **Logistics** ‚Äì Supplies, comms, delays
5. **Morale** ‚Äì Panic, retreat, refusal
6. **Output** ‚Äì Player reports

Text-based outputs:

```bash
[0530Z] UNIT FOXTROT: Ambushed patrol near Crossroads. 3 hostiles down. One casualty. Holding position.
```

### 3. Units & World State

* Units: Infantry, Recon, Armor, Engineers, Artillery, UAV
* Traits: morale, supplies, readiness, initiative
* Terrain: abstracted zones ("Ridge", "Bridgepoint", "Sector D5")
* World described in logs, not visualized

### 4. Game Modes

| Mode                 | Description                                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Skirmish**         | 2‚Äì4 players in short-form tactical matches     |
| **Campaign**         | Narrative PvE missions across linked scenarios |
| **Persistent World** | Long-form territory-based grand campaign       |
| **Duels**            | Real-time or asynchronous PvP                  |

## üß† Genre Definition: "Directive-Driven Tactical Sim"

| Element         | Description                             |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Input**       | Natural or structured command           |
| **Output**      | SITREPs, logs, and field reports        |
| **Uncertainty** | Fog of war, misintel, weather           |
| **Autonomy**    | Units act/react based on internal state |
| **Strategy**    | Deception, logistics, flanking, timing  |

## üß© Simulation Breakdown

### Order Parsing

* Language ‚Üí structured directive
* Intent tree generation
* Sequenced sub-actions

### State Management

* Zone-based abstract terrain
* Tick-based clock (e.g., 5‚Äì15 min steps)
* Global context: weather, radio jamming, delays

### Combat Resolution Factors

* Firepower ratio
* Initiative & surprise
* Cover & terrain bonuses
* Fatigue, morale, experience
* Support (e.g., artillery or air)

### Reports

All player feedback is via text:

* `"SIGINT: Intercepted chatter indicates movement east of Ridge"`
* `"ALPHA is pinned down. Ammunition low."`

---

## üîÅ Gameplay Loop

1. Player receives briefing / intel
2. Issues commands
3. Sim tick processes orders
4. Logs & SITREPs generated
5. Player re-assesses and adjusts
6. Loop continues until victory/defeat/abort

---

## üõ† Optional Systems

* **Signal Jamming**: orders may delay, garble, or fail
* **Commander AI**: traits per squad (cautious, aggressive)
* **PsyOps**: false intel, misinformation
* **Bandwidth Constraint**: limited # of orders per tick
* **Doctrine/Tech Trees**: unlocks for recon, EW, advanced tactics

---

## üó∫ Inspirations

* *Invisible Inc* (uncertainty + planning)
* *Dwarf Fortress ‚Äì Adventure Mode* (simulation over UI)
* *Command: Modern Operations* (realistic warfare logic)
* PBEM / Forum-based wargames
* Real-world military command structure

* *Ultimate Warfare*
* *Ambroid*, *Promisance*, *Earth-2025*
* *Naked War*
* *Xconq*
* *Door Kickers 2*

All have partial overlaps, but none hit the mark of TTW: deep tactical decision-making via command interface with no visual layer.

I‚Äôll walk you through how the game logic flows from command to outcome, and then outline what influences the simulation at each stage.


---

üîÑ Command-to-Outcome Pipeline (Game Tick Lifecycle)

Let‚Äôs break down what happens when a player issues a command and how the engine turns that into game state + output.

1. Command Issued

Player sends something like:

> Move Alpha to Ridge-3 before dawn under radio silence

2. Parsing + Intent Extraction

Command is parsed into a structured directive:

{
  unit: "Alpha",
  action: "move",
  destination: "Ridge-3",
  time_constraint: "before 0600Z",
  modifiers: ["stealth"]
}

This parsing phase involves:

Tokenization (semantic segmentation)

Entity extraction (units, objectives, time)

Intent classification (move, attack, hold, etc.)

Modifier interpretation (e.g., "radio silence" implies comms delay)



---

3. Action Queueing / Scheduling

Parsed directive is added to a tick-based scheduler.

tickEngine.queueAction({
  unitId: "Alpha",
  action: "move",
  targetZone: "Ridge-3",
  startTick: currentTick,
  conditions: ["radio_silence"],
  deadline: tickBefore(0600Z),
});


---

4. Tick Processing Loop

Each game tick (e.g., every 5 min simulated), the engine runs:

a. Prep Phase

Units start executing commands (e.g., Alpha begins moving)

Delay modifiers (e.g., stealth = slower)

Logistics check (e.g., enough fuel, no blocked roads)

Signal jamming may garble or delay commands


b. Contact Detection

Based on proximity, recon, or sound, opposing units may become aware of each other

Random rolls + modifiers determine whether contact occurs this tick


c. Combat Phase

If contact:

Calculate surprise/initiative (who saw whom first)

Check terrain bonuses

Resolve combat round(s)


Example:

resolveCombat({
  attacker: "Alpha",
  defender: "Foxtrot",
  terrain: "Ridge",
  modifiers: ["stealth", "high_ground"],
});

d. Morale + Behavior Checks

Is unit low on ammo?

Are they pinned or flanked?

What‚Äôs their morale and personality trait?

Trigger possible refusal to follow next command or initiate retreat


e. Logistics Phase

Ammo, supplies, medical evac

Resupply progress if initiated in previous ticks

Communications: were new orders received?



---

5. Simulation State Update

World state is updated:

Zones are marked with presence or conflict

Unit positions adjusted

Morale/fatigue values updated



---

6. Generate Output

Player receives:

[0545Z] ALPHA reached Ridge-3 under cover of darkness. No enemy contact.
[0550Z] FOXTROT reports spotting movement east. Possible UAV pinged.

Generated using a templated message system that factors:

Outcome

Confidence (was the info partial or intercepted?)

Style (based on player preferences or mission tone)



---

üß† Key Factors that Influence the Simulation

Here are the primary inputs to the simulation engine each tick:

üéØ Command Factors

Action type: move, recon, engage, extract

Modifiers: stealth, speed, delay, deception

Constraints: time, conditions, dependencies


ü™ñ Unit Traits

Morale, fatigue, experience

Loadout (weapons, gear)

Commander behavior (aggressive, cautious, defiant)


üåç World State

Zone traits (e.g., "Ridge-3" = high ground, low visibility)

Time of day (e.g., "before dawn" = lower visibility)

Weather (rain = reduced mobility and recon)

Fog of war / jamming zones


üî´ Opponent Behavior

Enemy AI may:

Patrol

Ambush

Delay movement

Fall back


Your actions influence theirs (especially in PvP or adaptive AI)

Let me know if you want this formalized into actual code architecture (e.g., XState logic, ECS layout with miniplex), or if you want to prototype a specific action simulation loop.
