# Game Development Architecture Prompt

## Core Architectural Principles

- Use composition over inheritance
- Implement functional programming techniques
- Utilize signals and state machines
- Focus on runtime behavior flexibility
- Prioritize modular, reusable component design

## Key Design Patterns

1. Behavior Composition

   - Define behaviors as pure functions
   - Use type-safe interfaces
   - Allow runtime behavior swapping
   - Minimize class-based complexity

2. Event-Driven Architecture

   - Create centralized event bus
   - Implement decoupled event handlers
   - Support dynamic event registration
   - Enable seamless state transitions

3. State Management
   - Use immutable state updates
   - Implement functional state reducers
   - Support dynamic behavior injection
   - Minimize side effects

## Technical Implementation Strategies

- Leverage TypeScript for type safety
- Use functional programming principles
- Create behavior factories
- Implement pure update functions
- Support runtime component swapping

## Performance Considerations

- Use lightweight, pure functions
- Minimize object creation
- Leverage functional composition
- Implement efficient state updates
- Use memoization where appropriate

## Advanced Techniques

- Implement finite state machines
