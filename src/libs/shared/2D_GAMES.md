Game Development Prompt: 2D Game with React Three Fiber

Project Goal:
Create a 2D game using React Three Fiber, focusing on sprite-based character and game mechanics.

Technical Stack:

- React Three Fiber
- React Three Drei
- Rapier.js (physics)
- Zustand (state management)
- TypeScript (optional but recommended)

Key Development Requirements:

1. Sprite-Based Character System

- Implement multi-directional sprite animations
- Support movement and idle states
- Use sprite sheets for efficient rendering
- Handle keyboard/input events

2. Game Mechanics to Implement:

- Character movement
- Basic collision detection
- State management for game progress
- Simple game loop

3. Rendering Approach:

- Use orthographic camera
- Optimize for 2D rendering
- Minimize performance overhead

Specific Implementation Questions:

- How to create sprite animations?
- What's the best way to handle character movement?
- How to manage game state?
- Techniques for collision detection?

Constraints:

- Web-based game
- Performance-optimized
- Responsive design
- Cross-browser compatibility

Desired Outcome:
A fully functional 2D game prototype with:

- Animated sprite character
- Basic movement mechanics
- Simple game loop
- Clean, modular React component structure

Specific Areas Needing Guidance:

- Sprite sheet management
- Input handling
- Physics integration
- State management strategies

Additional Context:

- Prefer lightweight, performant solutions
- Minimize external dependencies
- Focus on clean, readable code
- Prioritize web standards and modern React practices

Potential Game Concepts:

- Top-down RPG
- Platformer
- Simple adventure game
- Puzzle game

Preferred Development Approach:

- Incremental development
- Component-based architecture
- Modular game systems

Technical Preferences:

- Hooks-based implementation
- Functional components
- TypeScript type safety
