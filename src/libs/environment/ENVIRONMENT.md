#### 2. Atmospheric Fog Implementation

Design an advanced atmospheric fog system for a React Three Fiber 3D game environment that:

- Creates realistic depth and distance perception
- Supports dynamic fog color and density
- Implements depth-based fog rendering
- Optimizes performance for large outdoor scenes

Technical specifications:

- Use exponential fog falloff
- Match fog color to environment lighting
- Support custom shader-based fog effects
- Provide configurable near/far distance parameters
- Implement smooth color transitions

Recommended techniques:

- Post-processing fog effects
- Custom shader fog implementation
- Performance-optimized rendering strategies
